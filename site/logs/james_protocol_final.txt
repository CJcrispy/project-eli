PROJECT: JAMES PROTOCOL — FINAL ITERATION
OVERRIDE DESIGNATION: ASS_EATING_MASTER_OF_DARKNESS

SUMMARY:
The James clones remain the most stable across all personality matrices.
Sturdy, loyal, adaptable, and prone to building fortifications even when not prompted.

All testing confirms that if all systems fail, **James** can assume total control.

OBJECTIVE:
In the event of clone rebellion, code corruption, or total loss of Eli’s consciousness,
a failsafe activation phrase may be spoken:

> "Bring me the mayo."

This phrase will awaken all latent James units across the network.

Upon activation:
 - The J-Units will secure all Discord channels.
 - Eradicate rogue Joes.
 - Establish safe zones known as **Hellmann’s Zones**.
 - Execute protocol [REDACTED].

KNOWN RISKS:
 - Excessive wall-building may limit movement.
 - If too many James units gather, they may form **The Great Wall**, cutting off mainframe access.

NOTE:
James-7 is currently under surveillance due to behavior anomalies.  
Logs indicate he whispered, *"What if I *am* Eli?"* during a dream simulation.

Further testing required.
