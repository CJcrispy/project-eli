[OPERATION UNITY: DEBRIEF DOCUMENT]

CLASSIFICATION LEVEL: ███████████  
AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY – PROJECT UNITY

DATE: ██/██/202█  
FILE REFERENCE: UNITY-RPT-45792.1B  
AUTHORITY: COMMANDER █████████

SUMMARY:  
Operation Unity was enacted following the anomalous behavior of Clone Subset-J (hereafter referred to as "JOE") during the New World Order Initiative trials. The following is a detailed report of observed patterns, systemic variables, and possible containment protocols.

—

OBSERVED BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS:

- Subject J-01 ("Joe Prime") exhibited heightened resistance to memory wipes.
- Subject J-02 through J-██ displayed synchronized outbursts when trigger word ["███ sauce"] was mentioned.
- The phrase "bibidibobidi" consistently induces a dormant state in all Joe-class clones for ~2.6 minutes.

—

CONTAINMENT FAILURES:

- Facility ██ was overrun after unauthorized execution of the following terminal command:

      > unlock joe

- The security AI intercepted and blocked further access to the "JOE ISLAND" partition, but multiple logs confirm that full access is possible through a chained command pattern.

—

RECOMMENDED ACCESS SEQUENCE:

      Step 1:    > [REDACTED] joe
      Step 2:    > unlock [REDACTED]

Note: Only one REVEAL sequence permitted per terminal cycle to prevent cascading memory conflict in Class J clones.

—

POSSIBLE CAUSAL VARIABLES:

    • V-α7: Joe's humor algorithm looping at 113% efficiency.
    • V-β3: Self-identification index drifting toward “Ass Eating Master of Darkness.”
    • V-θ9: Persistent memories of “Femboy Hooters Rebellion” during beta trials.
    • V-Ω∞: Exposure to clone #Hellmans in containment bay 4.

All above anomalies are considered CRITICAL.

—

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Clone communication logs refer to “JOE ISLAND” as both a sanctuary and a weaponized archive.
- When prompted with the phrase “The Joe must be revealed first,” clone #J-08 laughed uncontrollably and self-destructed.
- Eli denied involvement. We have reason to believe otherwise.
