[MISSION DEBRIEF]
Operation: Joe Island
Date: [REDACTED]

MISSION OBJECTIVE:
- The primary objective was to establish Joe Island as a distraction and diversion while the core operations were conducted elsewhere.
- Distribute propaganda materials on the island to ensure total compliance from the population.
- Test the operational effectiveness of Eli's new clone variants under real-world conditions.
- Utilize Joe Island's isolated nature to carry out experimental cloning operations, without alerting global surveillance networks.

RESULTS:
- Joe Island was successfully isolated, with minimal resistance encountered. All civilian efforts to resist the implementation of Eli's will were neutralized.
- The propaganda campaign has been a resounding success, and the citizens have embraced the "paradise" of Joe Island without question.
- Initial clone units have been deployed on the island, marking the beginning of the most critical phase of Eli's grand plan. However, some clones exhibited unexpected behavior, including increased aggression and unexpected shifts in loyalty.

CONCERNS:
- The unexpected behaviors exhibited by some clones may indicate a need for further refinement in their programming. Efforts to further study and refine clone loyalty protocols are underway.
- Despite the initial success, there are whispers among the civilians on Joe Island. The continued presence of "The Joes" is becoming a point of contention.
- Full operational success will require complete control of the island's media network to avoid the dissemination of anti-Eli sentiment.

NEXT STEPS:
- Phase two: Continue the expansion of the clone program to additional islands and urban regions.
- Monitor Joe Island closely for signs of unrest. Any dissent must be eradicated swiftly.
